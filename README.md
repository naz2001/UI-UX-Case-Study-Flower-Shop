# UI/UX Case Study: Flower Shop

This project was done as a part of the "Create High-Fidelity Designs and Prototypes in Figma" course in Coursera. The topic that I took was to Design an application for the purchase and delivery of flowers. The project design process had several phases:
- Emphasize with users, defining problems and user goals.
- Create user journey maps.
- Create a site map.
- Create paper and digital wireframes.
- Create a high-fidelity prototype.
- Test using insights and recommendations.

## Problem Statement

Lisa is a florist who needs a bouquet preview app  because they need users to know what will be delivered when ordering online and other features that will increase customers as well as user usability.

## Goal Statement

Our bouquet preview app will let users buy flower bouquets online along with other items like confectionary and balloons which will affect how effortlessly customers can purchase gifts and such by giving customers a user interface with a short learning curve. We will measure effectiveness by analyzing usability and customer interactions along with the trend in sales.

## UX Design Process

I spent some time learning about the people I needed to help, like what their pain points are, what their fears are, and what motivates them. I also looked into the market, what the competition was like, and what other solutions were out there. I then came up with a solution based on the info I had gathered in the first two steps. I used the info from the first usability study to make some small changes to the Lo-Fi prototype and then converted it to a Hi-Fi prototype. I also tested the Hi-Fi prototype in the 2nd usability study to make sure it was ready to be used in production and on the market. Finally, I evaluated the whole UX Design process and took feedback from users into account to see how successful it was.

#### Research questions
- How often and on what occasions are flowers bought by people?
- Do the visual elements in the app support the customers in navigating through the app?
- Would you prefer to buy flowers at a shop or online?
- When buying flowers online what is easier or more difficult than when buying them at a shop?
- What factors are taken into consideration when buying flowers?

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Time on task: How long it takes a user to complete a task. Be sure to account for all the factors that could affect your data, like participants with accessibility needs.
- Use of navigation vs. search: The number of users who find things through browsing, compared to those who use the search function to find what they need
- Conversion rates: The number of users who reach their goal successfully
- System Usability Scale, or SUS: 10 questions evaluating how easy or hard the product is to use

#### Participants

- Gender (Women, Men, and other genders)
- Background (Working/Non-working/Student)
- Age (20 - 55)
- Accessibility needs 

## User Flow

A user flow is like a visual roadmap that illustrates the sequence of steps a user follows to achieve a specific task within a website or application. It visually lays out the pages, screens, and interactions the user encounters on their path to completing their objective. In the case of the flower catalog application, I constructed a user flow that outlines the journey of exploring, selecting, customizing, and ultimately purchasing a bouquet of flowers. This process enabled me to pinpoint any potential challenges or areas where users might require additional assistance, ensuring that the design supports their journey at every stage.

User flow creation is an indispensable part of the design process. It acts as a quality assurance tool, guaranteeing that the website or application is user-friendly and easy to navigate, providing a seamless user experience. By doing so, I could spot and address any potential issues before any coding or development work begins, making it a cost-effective and time-efficient approach to crafting a user-centric design.

I carried out user testing involving a diverse group of participants to collect data on their actions, opinions, and overall perceptions. The results of this testing revealed that the app featured a clear and structured navigation system. However, some users suggested the inclusion of alternative filters beyond just price and color. Additionally, the "Make your own Bouquet" option appeared to be confusing for many users. Based on these discoveries, I was able to formulate specific recommendations for enhancing the app's user-friendliness. These recommendations included the addition of search filters and simplifying the checkout process. In essence, the usability study yielded valuable insights that will play a crucial role in enhancing the user experience within the flower shop app.
